### Acknowledgement
The original source for the spec file was derived from the mosh project's [fedora/mosh.spec](https://github.com/mobile-shell/mosh/blob/master/fedora/mosh.spec) file. This is maintained as best effort, so as to provided an automated build for EL RPM until it is added into the official epel or Red Hat repositories.
